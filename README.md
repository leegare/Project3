# Project3

## Introduction and Goal: 

If you aspire to be environmental-friendly, avoid your city's traffic and your city has a public bicycle sharing system like the Velib in France, the Santander Cycles in London or the Capital Bikeshare in Washington D.C. then you as a responsible Earth-dweller may have been confronted to two problems: not finding a bike in your nearest bike station and not finding a free spot at your destination's station. To answer this issue, the bike's company needs to know the variability of the demand throughout time. 

This project analyzes the statistical measures of the demand in rental bikes in function of the time, day in the year as well as the weather. 

## Questions for Exploration

1. What's the distribution of the demand for rental bikes throughout time? Is the demand higher in the weekdays than the weekends? In any normal day, is there a pattern in the bike-usage over the course of time? 

2. Is there a difference in usage between a casual and a registered user? (Are they statistically different?)

3. How influential is the weather with both users? Will a nice day be more enticing to use the bike over a rainy day? Does the wind or temperature discourage people to take the bike? 

4. Can the temperature felt be characterized by a combination of windspeed, humidity and official temperature? 

5. Can we predict the count of bikers given the time, day and weather?
